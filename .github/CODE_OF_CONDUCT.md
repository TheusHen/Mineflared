## Our Responsibilities

They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, Discord servers (if applicable), and all other community communication channels.

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
